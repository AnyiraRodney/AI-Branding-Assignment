ðŸ“Œ Phase 3: Client Outreach & Monetization

In this final phase, we explored how to position and sell our AI-powered branding services to potential clients.

1. **Sales Pitch Email**  
   Using ChatGPT, we created a persuasive email targeted at startups. The email outlines the benefits of using AI branding and encourages the client to consider our services.

2. **Pitch Deck Slide**  
   A clean, professional Canva slide was designed to visually summarize the advantages of AI branding, such as speed, cost-efficiency, and design consistency.
