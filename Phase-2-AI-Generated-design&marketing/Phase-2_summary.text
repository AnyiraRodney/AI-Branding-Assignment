ðŸ“Œ Phase 2: AI-Generated Design & Marketing Content

In this phase, we focused on showcasing how AI can be used to design and promote a digital branding agency. The key tasks included:

1. **Social Media Content**  
   Using ChatGPT, we generated five engaging social media post ideas that promote our AI-powered branding services. Each post includes a clear call to action to drive user engagement and awareness.

2. **Website Mockup**  
   A website homepage was designed using Canva, highlighting the agencyâ€™s services, tagline, and visual identity. This mockup reflects the sleek and tech-driven aesthetic of our brand.

3. **Marketing Copy**  
   A blog post was written using ChatGPT to explain the competitive advantage of using AI-powered branding. It targets startups and small businesses looking to modernize and scale efficiently.
